Near the Rabbit Hole., The ground is soft and the air is thick with the scent of freshly turned earth. A large oak tree looms above with roots tangled and knotted like the thoughts of a daydreamer. A faint rustling comes from the bushes nearby. The rabbit hole looks like an irrevocable decision.,Room 2,Room 3,Room 4

Room 4, The walls of this room are covered in rich red velvet. A large golden chandelier hangs from the ceiling casting a warm glow on the floor below.

Room 5, A perfectly symmetrical room with walls painted like the night sky. Stars twinkle and shift as if alive. All the doors look the same. There is a twinkling object on the ground and near it you see the glow of two cat-like eyes.,Room 4,Room 6,Room 5
Room 6, The walls are covered in a patchwork of brightly colored fabrics. Each square seems to tell a different story. A large loom sits in the corner with a half-finished tapestry hanging from it. The tapestry looks like it could fly away with just a  breeze of wind.,Room 5,Room 7,Room 4
Room 7, This room is filled with over-sized furniture making you feel small and insignificant. A giant cake is arranged on a table with plates the size of radar dish and a teapot that could fill a bathtub. You wonder how you know what a radar dish is.,Room 6,Room 8,Room 9

Room 11, A dimly lit room with a single light shining down on a small curtain. The curtains are drawn and the air is thick with dust and the light seems to be fighting to push the darkness back. A faint whisper can be heard coming from behind the stage.,Room 10,Room 12,Room 13
Room 12, The floor is covered in a layer of fine yellow sand. In the center of the room is a large hourglass with sand slowly trickling down.

Room 13, A room filled with hanging lanterns of every shape and size. The light from the lanterns casts strange shadows on the walls.

Room 14, The walls are a dull shade of gray with no discernible features. The floor is cold and smooth to the touch. There is no sound. No scent. No movement.

Room 15, This room is filled with oversized mushrooms in various shades of red and purple. The air is thick with the scent of earth and damp moss.
