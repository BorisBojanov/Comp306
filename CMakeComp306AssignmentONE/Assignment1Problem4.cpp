DOCUMENTATION

Program Purpose:
    The program will include a looping structure to both receive user input and process it until the user wishes to quit. 
    It will use a switch structure to handle the input and display the appropriate help information.
    Your program includes help for the following C++ terms:

    if
    switch
    for
    while
    doâ€“while

    Here is a sample output from the program:

    C++ Help Menu
    Select Help on:
    1. If
    2. Switch
    3. For
    4. While
    5. Do-while
    x. Exit

    Selection: 3

    for: . . .definition. . .

    C++ Help Menu
    Select Help on:
    1. If
    2. Switch
    3. For
    4. While
    5. Do-while
    x. Exit

    Selection: x

    Thank you. Good bye.

    Compile (assuming Cygwin is running): g++ -o Assignment1Problem4 Assignment1Problem4.cpp
    Execution (assuming Cygwin is running): ./Assignment1Problem4.exe

    Classes: none

    Variables:
        input - string - used to store the user's input
        validInput - bool - used to store the validity of the user's input
        target - int - used to store the user's input as an integer
        help - string - used to store the help information for the user's input
