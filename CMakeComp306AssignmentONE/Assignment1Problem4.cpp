/*
Problem 4 C++ help menue

The program must include a looping structure to both receive user input and process it until the user wishes to quit. 
Use a switch structure to handle the input and display the appropriate help.

Your program must include help for the following C++ terms:

if
switch
for
while
doâ€“while

Here is a sample output from the program:

C++ Help Menu
Select Help on:
1. If
2. Switch
3. For
4. While
5. Do-while
x. Exit

Selection: 3

for: . . .definition. . .

C++ Help Menu
Select Help on:
1. If
2. Switch
3. For
4. While
5. Do-while
x. Exit

Selection: x

Thank you. Good bye.
