DOCUMENTATION
Program Purpose:
Create a point class to represent a point with x and y coordinates
Create a shape class to represent a shape with a vector of points. 
The Shape class will contain default functions to calculate area and circumference of the shape, 
and provide the coordinates (Points) of a rectangle that encloses the shape (a bounding box).
These will be overloaded by the derived classes; therefore, 
the default methods for Shape will only print a simple message to standard output.
