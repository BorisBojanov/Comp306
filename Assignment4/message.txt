Explanation of the New Design:
Control Class:

readInput(): This method handles reading user input via std::getline. It prompts the user for an action, checks if the action is valid, and then calls the corresponding method in the Actions class.
isValidAction(): This method checks if the input string corresponds to a valid action by using a std::map of valid actions (pickup, location, attack, etc.). If the action is valid, it returns true, otherwise false.
Based on the input, the corresponding action (e.g., pickUpInventory(), changeLocationFlags(), etc.) is executed.
Game Class:

startGame(): This method enters a loop where it continuously reads input from the user until the game is manually exited. It delegates the input handling to the Control class.
Actions Class:

This class defines the various actions available in the game (e.g., picking up inventory, changing location flags, attacking an enemy, etc.). These methods are called by Control based on user input.
Example Execution Flow:
The Game object is created and initialized, which in turn creates a Control object (which has access to the Actions object).
The startGame() method enters a loop and repeatedly asks for user input.
The user enters a command like pickup, location, or attack.
The Control class reads the input, checks if it's valid using the isValidAction() method, and if valid, it calls the corresponding method in Actions to execute the action.
If the user enters an invalid action, they are prompted again to try a valid input.
